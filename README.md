# SaberDiscordBot
AP Comp project: Making a discord bot.

Basically got bored and decided to make this. This will update live when I decied to work on the bot lol.

The "StartingBatchFile" is purely experimental as of right now... I don't think it will work, but I'll test it later.

Also, Batch files only work on windows systems, so I plan on making an EXE that will auto run the Saber.py script and activate the bot when I call for it.
